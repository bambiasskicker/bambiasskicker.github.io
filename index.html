                        Japanese culture has its own unique forms of comic books and animation. Manga (comic books) and anime (animation) are extremely popular in Japan. The earliest animation that is known to have been created in Japan was released in 1917. This early cartoon featured a samurai testing a sword and being defeated. Japanese animation pioneers included Seitar≈ç Kitayama, Jun'ichi Kouchi, and Shimokawa Oten. The modern style of anime was developed during the 1960s. One of the most influential artists is Osamu Tezuka. He followed the example set by Walt Disney's popular animated films and simplified the techniques they pioneered to save time and money. Today's anime is both generated by computers and drawn by hand.

                        <h2>The Director Behind 'Cowboy Bebop' Is Working On A New Anime Short For 'Blade Runner'</h2>
                    </header>
                    <p>
                        With the release of Blade Runner 2049 imminent, director Shinichiro Watanabe is working on a new anime short called Blade Runner Black Out 2022.

                        Considering that the original Blade Runner is set in 2019, there is an obvious and large 30-year gap between that and the new film.

                        So having shorts like 2036: Nexus Dawn directed by Luke Scott helps to fill in the blanks. However, I am surprised to see that another of these shorts will be taking an anime form.


                        For anyone that knows and cares about anime, Shinichiro Watanabe is a noteworthy figure. Most known for his work on directing Cowboy Bebop, he also worked on series such as Macross Plus and Gundam 0083.</p>
